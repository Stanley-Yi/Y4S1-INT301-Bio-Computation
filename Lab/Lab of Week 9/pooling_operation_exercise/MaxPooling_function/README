Mex implementation of the max-pooling operation for 4D tensors.
Supports also the case when the input dims (rows, cols) are not multiples of the
pooling dims.

It is a template function and at the moment single and double precision are 
supported.

Implements also a multithread processing using openmp along the channels.

To compile without openmp:
    mex CFLAGS="-funroll-loops -O2" MaxPooling.cpp 

To compile with openmp:
    /Applications/MATLAB_R2010b.app/bin/mex MaxPooling.cpp -v 
        LDFLAGS="\$LDFLAGS -fopenmp" 
        CXXFLAGS="\$CXXFLAGS -fopenmp -O2 -funroll-loops" 
        CFLAGS="\$CFLAGS -fopenmp -O2 -funroll-loops" 
        COPTIMFLAGS="$COPTIMFLAGS -fopenmp" 
        CC="gcc-4.2 -DOPENMP" CXX="g++-4.2 -DOPENMP" LD="g++-4.2"
        -largeArrayDims 
        

in practice just define OPENMP with the corresponding flags.

Implemented the first version of the mex file. Tested a little and seems ok.
